# 🎓 Exam Management System – Built with Just JavaScript

Say hello to the **Exam Management System**, a full-stack web app where teachers can create exams, share them with students, and view results in real-time.

No React. No TypeScript. No fancy frameworks. Just **pure JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, built to challenge myself and explore the pure power of the web.

## 🌱 The Idea Behind It

As a frontend developer, I usually rely on modern tools like React or TypeScript. But for this project, I wanted to go back to basics.

So I set a challenge: **Build a real app with no frameworks**. Just pure code.

The goal? To sharpen my problem-solving skills, master the DOM, and better understand how everything works under the hood.
